    <h1>THE INDIAN FLAG</h1>
    <p>
      The National flag of India is a horizontal tricolor of deep saffron
      (kesari) at the top, white in the middle and dark green at the bottom in
      equal proportion. The ratio of width of the flag to its length is two to
      three. In the centre of the white band is a navy blue wheel which
      represents the chakra. Its design is that of the wheel which appears on
      the abacus of the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka. Its diameter
      approximates to the width of the white band and it has 24 spokes.

                Saffron color indicates the strength and courage of the country.

            <h3>The Chakra</h3>
            <p>
              This Dharma Chakra depicted the "wheel of the law" in the Sarnath
              Lion Capital made by the 3rd-century BC Mauryan Emperor Ashoka.
              The chakra intends to show that there is life in movement and
              death in stagnation.
